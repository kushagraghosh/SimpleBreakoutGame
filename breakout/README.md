This project implements the game of Breakout.

### Timeline

Start Date: 1/16/22

Finish Date: 1/18/22

Hours Spent: 15

### Resources Used
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/animation/AnimationTimer.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/input/KeyCode.html
https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_files_read.asp

### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: level1.txt, level2.txt, level3.txt

Key/Mouse inputs: RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN, W, S, A, D, L, R

Cheat keys: Shift paddle left and right, grow paddle, shrink paddle, grow ball, shrink ball, Randomly recolor ball, Randomly recolor paddle, Add a life, Reset the ball


### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications: Brick breaks when intersecting around the vicinity of the top left of the ball.

Known Bugs: N/A

Extra features or interesting things we should not miss: 

Paddle can be controlled by arrow keys and mouse, and can stop at edges to not go off the screen.

Text field labeling when game is over, how many lives you are on, and what level you are on.

3 levels based on text input, and semantic change to indicate game is over afterwards.


### Impressions

Very insightful project that was foundational to my understanding of JavaFX. In the future, more JavaFX code examples like Lab_bounce could be provided before this assignment to make the transition between no JavaFX knowledge and this project easier.
